J.U.F.F.R.O.U.

 Juffrou stands for Java Utilities Framework For the Rest Of Us and is a collection of useful classes or mini frameworks to help the java developer.

 Checkout the juffrou-reflect module if you are into performant java bean hendling.
 
 I have been developing on enterprise java application for many years always relying on the springframework / hibernate stack
 and built some utility classes along the way. I created Juffrou to share these utility classes/framework with the development community
 and hope that can be useful to you.
